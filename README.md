---------------------------------- ADDITIONAL NOTES ----------------------------------

Iris and Starline and Sodium Starline and all of that is going to be OFFICIALLY released on June 8th, 2021. Depending on any bugs found, their ratings will change accordingly
Sodium Extra will usually not crash your world but sometimes it has issues with forks of Sodium
Dashloader crashes with numerous mods that add custom baked models (like things from Adorn and tech mods that add things like pipes) and it crashes with Hydrogen (memory optimization mod from CaffeineMC). It also crashes with the standard Curseforge release of Sodium.
If you have a lot of mods (no exact number) Cadmium will crash
There's really no need to use Cadmium as of now. LazyDFU is a far, far better choice for now.
Phosphor is a lighting engine optimization mod from CaffeineMC but it has issues with random chunks turning dark. Starlight is faster but slightly less stable and does not have this issue.
