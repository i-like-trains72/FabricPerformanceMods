---------------------------------- ADDITIONAL NOTES ----------------------------------
Iris and Starline and Sodium Starline and all of that is going to be OFFICIALLY released on June 8th, 2021. Depending on any bugs found, their ratings will change accordingly
Sodium Extras is INCOMPATIBLE WITH IRIS AND ITS FORKS. Also incompat with Sodium 0.2.0

Some more notes on Sodium and Iris since it's kind of confusing
1) You can choose between Sodium and normal Iris
2) You can choose betwen Sodium and the Starline fork of Iris
3) The Starline fork has a configuration menu for shaders while standard Iris does not
You can choose what to use, just **don't combine both of the Iris mods**

**Dashloader crashes with numerous mods that add custom baked models (like things from Adorn and tech mods that add things like pipes) and it crashes with Hydrogen (memory optimization mod from CaffeineMC). It also crashes with the standard Curseforge release of Sodium. It can also randomly not work for some users, I do not recommend it if you change resourcepacks or mods often.**

If you have a lot of mods (no exact number) Cadmium will crash sometimes
There's really no need to use Cadmium as of now. LazyDFU is a far, far better choice for now.
Phosphor is a lighting engine optimization mod from CaffeineMC, Starlight is faster but is **incompatible with Phosphor** and is also experimental. Chunk loading speeds are improved
Krypton is a bit weird sometimes, be cautious

To my knowledge, Starlight is the only mod on here that works on the Fridge modloader (synonym for the modloader that has Create and ATM6)
