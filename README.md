# FabricPerformanceMods
I try to keep them updated. For 1.17.1!
**THESE MODS ARE NOT OWNED BY ME THEREFORE THEIR LICENSE STILL REMAINS. GIVE THE DEVS CREDIT, NOT ME! I AM ONLY USING THIS AS A WAY FOR PEOPLE TO EASILY DOWNLOAD PERFORMANCE MODS!**

-You can now find updates in #overlord-lair in my Discord!

-Sodium-iris and Iris-starline are incompatible with Sodium/next.

-C2me may cause issues on very low-end devices.

-Fabric API **may or may not** be needed, this guide assumes you know how to read simple crash log errors and fix them, i.e. not having Java 16 or updating Fabric API

-------------------- Keys ---------------------------------

-Mods that are mostly/completely safe (meaning any possible errors can be fixed without permanent damage) will be marked with: ✔️

-Mods that are *not* mostly/completely safe will be marked with: ✖️

-Mods that are mixed will be marked with: ❗

-Please read the Additional Notes section, it has vital information

---------------------------------- ADDITIONAL NOTES ----------------------------------

**Dashloader crashes with numerous mods that add custom baked models (like things from Adorn and tech mods that add things like pipes) and it crashes with Hydrogen (memory optimization mod from CaffeineMC). It can also randomly not work for some users, I do not recommend it if you change resourcepacks or mods often.**

-Cadmium may crash sometimes, especially with too many mods

-Phosphor is a lighting engine optimization mod from CaffeineMC, Starlight is faster but is **incompatible with Phosphor** and is also experimental. Chunk loading speeds are improved, and Starlight maintains vanilla parity. You cannot use Starlight and Phosphor together. You **can** join servers if you have Starlight or Phosphor.

-Krypton can cause numerous wonky issues across systems when joining servers, it will work best if you're on a normal SMP, as opposed to something like Hypixel or a heavily modded server.
