---------------------------------- ADDITIONAL NOTES ----------------------------------

-Iris Starline and Sodium Starline has been officially released. There may be a few rendering issues, but none that are game breaking.

-Entity Culling can cause some entities to flicker, especially when paired with Iris and a heavy shaderpack.

-Sodium Extra will usually not crash your world but sometimes it has issues with forks of Sodium

-Dashloader crashes with numerous mods that add custom baked models (like things from Adorn and tech mods that add things like pipes).

-If you have a lot of mods (no exact number) Cadmium may crash. There's really no need to use Cadmium as of now. LazyDFU is a far, far better choice for now. However, if you want to get maximum loading speeds, you can use both together.

Phosphor is a lighting engine optimization mod from CaffeineMC but it has issues with random chunks turning dark. Starlight is faster but slightly less stable and does not have this issue. Overall, starlight is superior.
